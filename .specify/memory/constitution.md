# Greendex 2.0 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User Privacy & GDPR Compliance
All features MUST minimise collection of personal data and treat any personal
data as sensitive. Personal data storage MUST be explicit and pseudonymised
where possible; retention MUST be the minimal period required. All processing
for EU users MUST comply with GDPR. The project MUST provide mechanisms for
consent, data export, and deletion (user-facing controls and an administrative
process).

Rationale: Greendex handles mobility and travel data tied to individuals and
institutions. User privacy and legal compliance are non-negotiable.

### II. Accuracy & Transparency
All CO₂ calculations, emission factors, and dataset sources MUST be
documented, versioned, and reproducible. Any assumption or approximation used
in outputs MUST be exposed in the UI and documentation, with a link to the
dataset and its version.

Rationale: Outputs inform decisions and reporting; transparency and auditability
are essential to stakeholder trust.

### III. Accessibility & Inclusivity
UI and content MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The application MUST support
the primary Erasmus+ languages (at minimum) and be responsive for mobile use.
Interfaces MUST function acceptably on low-bandwidth networks.

Rationale: Erasmus+ serves diverse users across Europe; accessibility and
language coverage are essential for fairness and adoption.

### IV. Test-First & Reproducibility (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All new features MUST include tests before implementation: unit tests for core
logic, contract tests for APIs, and integration/e2e tests for critical flows.
The CO₂ calculation engine MUST have deterministic tests that assert expected
numerical outputs for known inputs and dataset versions.

Rationale: Calculation correctness and reproducibility are central to the
project's mission and credibility.

### V. Simplicity & Maintainability
Favor clear, well-documented solutions over premature optimisation. Modules
MUST have a clear responsibility, be well-typed, and include inline and
repository-level documentation. Code MUST pass linting and formatting checks
before merge.

Rationale: Simpler code lowers risk, aids audits (privacy/security), and eases
contribution from partner institutions.

## Technical & Compliance Constraints

- **Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router), custom server at `src/server.ts`,
	`Better-Auth` (Drizzle adapter) for authentication, `drizzle` + PostgreSQL for
	DB, `shadcn` + Tailwind for UI components.
- **Authentication**: Use `Better-Auth` with the Drizzle/Postgres adapter as the
	canonical auth solution. OAuth providers for institutional logins are allowed
	but MUST be configured to limit scopes and present clear privacy notices.
- **Data Handling**: Persist mobility and event records in Postgres. Separate
	personally-identifying information from analytic datasets when possible
	(pseudonymisation). Document data retention policies in `docs/privacy.md`.
- **Security**: Secrets MUST be stored in environment variables or a secrets
	manager. TLS is required in all environments exposing user data. Follow OWASP
	guidance and perform threat modeling for sensitive components.
- **Privacy by Design**: Telemetry and logs MUST avoid storing personal
	identifiers. Introduce DPIA when adding new personal-data processing features.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

- **Branching**: Short-lived feature branches (e.g., `feature/xxx`), PRs to
	`main` only.
- **Code Review**: Every PR MUST have at least one approving reviewer and a
	successful CI run. Changes touching auth, data models, or calculation logic
	MUST be reviewed by a core maintainer.
- **CI/Tests**: PRs MUST run lint/format (biome), unit tests, and relevant
	integration tests. Critical calculation regressions MUST be prevented by
	automated tests tied to dataset versions.
- **Build / Release**: Local dev uses `bun run dev`. Production build follows
	`bun run build` -> `bun run start` and relies on compiled `out/server.js` as
	the authoritative artifact.
- **Documentation**: Specs, plans, and PR descriptions MUST reference the
	constitution when they affect privacy, calculations, accessibility, or
	governance.

## Governance

1. Proposal: Any change to this constitution or to governance-relevant policies
	 MUST be proposed via a repository pull request that includes a migration
	 plan (if applicable) and the rationale for the change.
2. Review & Approval: Constitutional amendments MUST be approved by at least
	 two core maintainers. For additions that materially change project
	 responsibilities (new principle or removal), approval MUST include a brief
	 stakeholder consultation (e-mail or issue thread) with partners.
3. Versioning Policy: The constitution follows semantic versioning for
	 governance text:
	 - MAJOR (X.0.0): Backwards-incompatible governance or principle removal/redefinition.
	 - MINOR (0.Y.0): New principle or substantive addition to governance.
	 - PATCH (0.0.Z): Clarifications, wording fixes, or editorial updates.
4. Compliance Review: Pull requests that change data handling, auth, or the
	 calculation engine MUST include a short 'Constitution Check' checklist
	 verifying applicable principles, and indicate required follow-ups (DPIA,
	 accessibility review, etc.).
