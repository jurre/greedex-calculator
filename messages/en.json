      "missionText": "Erasmus+ programme enables us to have amazing learning adventures with inspirational people from different countries. However, each of our personal gatherings contributes to a deep carbon footprint due to our travelling and living habits. The purpose of this project was to offset our carbon footprint on the projects we make by bringing more awareness and more action to change our habits. For this reason, we have created a carbon footprint calculator that is specialized for Erasmus+ projects such as youth exchanges, training courses, meetings etc. This calculator offers the final number of the CO₂ produced by each participant and transforms this number to the number of the average trees that will absorb our CO₂ in their lifetime. Our calculations are based on scientific research done by different professionals. We did not make our own calculations.",
      "visionTitle": "Our vision",
      "visionText": "We want to create a movement, where each Erasmus+ project calculates their carbon footprint and plants trees to offset it. We see several Erasmus+ forests rising in Europe which contribute to the cleaner air in Europe. We see young people continuing to learn together in a more sustainable environment, while travelling green, and enjoying the beauty of nature. This website has so much knowledge gathered for you, so take some time and search a bit around.",
