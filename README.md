# Greendex v2 — Carbon Footprint Calculator Portal

**Greendex v2** is a specialized web application and participant portal for managing and calculating the carbon footprint of **Erasmus+ projects** (youth exchanges, training courses, and mobility events). Built for educators, organizers, and participants to raise environmental awareness and inspire sustainable action.

## Overview

Greendex v2 provides a modern, user-friendly portal where project organizers can:
- **Create and manage organizations** for their Erasmus+ projects
- **Invite participants** and track team members across mobility events
- **Calculate CO₂ emissions** from participant journeys (transport modes, accommodation, energy)
- **Visualize sustainability impact** with individual and group-level analytics
- **Organize sustainability challenges** to reduce carbon footprint during projects
- **Plant trees** to offset calculated emissions and join the Greendex movement
- **Support workflows** including Green Moment (30 min), Green Deal (60 min), and Green Day (180 min) workshop formats

This next iteration (v2) redesigns the carbon calculator experience as a **multi-tenant SaaS portal** with:
- Real-time organization and team management via Better Auth
- Secure role-based access control (owner, admin, member)
- Ready-to-scale WebSocket infrastructure for real-time collaboration
- Database-first approach with Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or Node.js 18+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables (see `.env.example` or `.env`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/henningsieh/greedex-v2.git
cd greedex-v2

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file based on your configuration:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/greendex

# Authentication (Better Auth)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (Nodemailer)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-password

# OAuth (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-discord-client-secret
```

### Development

Run the development server with Socket.IO support (decoupled for memory leak prevention):
```bash
bun run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The Socket.IO server runs separately on port 4000.

### Build & Production

```bash
# Build: compile Next.js application
bun run build

# Start: run production server
bun run start

# Lint & format with Biome
bun run lint
bun run format
```

## Key Features — Phase 1 (Organization Registration & Dashboard)

✅ **Organization Onboarding** (US1)

- Only one org required to access the dashboard
- Unique slug validation with clear error handling

✅ **Dashboard Navigation** (US2)
- Tabbed interface: Dashboard, Team, Projects
- URL-based tab persistence (via `nuqs`)
- Responsive layout ready for mobile

✅ **Team Members Overview** (US3)

---

## Database & Migrations

The project uses **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL**. Better Auth automatically manages organization and member tables.

### Run migrations

```bash
# Generate migration files
bun run auth:generate

# Apply migrations
bun run db:migrate
```

Migrations are stored in `src/lib/drizzle/migrations/`.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

This project uses **Better Auth** with the **Organization Plugin** for:
- Email/password + OAuth (GitHub, Discord) authentication
- Multi-tenant organization management
- Role-based access control (owner, admin, member)
- Invitation workflows for adding team members

Configuration: `src/lib/better-auth/index.ts`  
Client: `src/lib/better-auth/auth-client.ts`

---

## WebSocket & Real-Time (Socket.IO)

A POC for **Socket.IO** is implemented in `src/socket-server.ts` (decoupled from the Next.js server):
- Run both servers in dev with `bun run dev` (starts Next.js on 3000 and Socket.IO on 4000)
- Use `bun run dev:inspect` to run an inspect/dev instance on `3001` and a socket server on `4001` (helps avoid port collisions while debugging)
- Production requires `bun run build` then `bun run start` (both `out/server.js` and `out/socket-server.js` will be launched)

To add real-time features (e.g., live team updates), attach Socket.IO event handlers in `src/socket-server.ts` and import the client in your React components.

---

## Code Quality & Linting

This project uses **Biome** for fast, zero-config linting and formatting.

```bash
# Lint
bun run lint

# Format
bun run format

# Check + fix (one command)
bun run lint --fix
```

Configuration: `biome.json`

---

## Deployment

### Recommended: Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect the repo to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy (Vercel automatically runs `bun run build` and `bun run start`)

### Self-Hosted (Docker / VPS)
1. Build locally or in CI/CD: `bun run build`
2. Set production env vars
3. Run: `bun run start` (expects `out/server.js` from build step)
4. Use a process manager (PM2, systemd) to keep the server running

---

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make changes and test locally with `bun run dev`
3. Lint & format: `bun run lint && bun run format`
4. Commit with descriptive messages
5. Push and open a PR

For detailed development guidance, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
